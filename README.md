## What is Squire VR?
Squire VR is a native Android app that lets you browse and download games directly from the VRP Games mirror on your headset.  
Think of it as a lightweight, standalone version of Rookie Sideloader.

---

## Features
- **No PC needed**  
  Download games directly on your Quest.

- **Resume support**  
  Pause and resume downloads anytime. Progress is saved even if the app closes.

- **Updates tab**  
  Automatically compares installed games with the mirror and shows available updates.

- **SQL database**  
  Replaces old `.txt` caching with a faster, more reliable database.

- **Smart download engine**  
  Self-healing logic to prevent common errors like `Error: null`.

- **Rookie logic**  
  Uses the same game lists and logic as the tools you already know.

- **Storage check**  
  Warns you if there isn’t enough space before downloading.

- **AutoSideload**  
  Automatically installs the APK and moves OBB files after download.

- **Downloaded status**  
  Installed games are clearly marked to prevent duplicates.

> **Tip:**  
> Wait for the local cache progress bar to finish before closing the app.
