## ⚡ Overview
**Squire VR** is a native Android application that allows you to browse and download games directly from the VRP Games mirror directly onto your Meta Quest. Think of it as a lightweight, standalone version of Rookie Sideloader. 

**No PC or phone required.**

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **💻 No PC Needed:** Download and install games directly on your Quest.
* **🤖 AutoSideload:** Automatically installs the APK and moves OBB files to the correct directories.
* **🔄 Resume Support:** Pause and resume your downloads at any time without losing progress.
* **📥 Smart Download Engine:** Built-in self-healing logic to prevent standard mirroring errors (like `Error: null`).
* **📈 Updates Tab:** Automatically compares your installed games with the mirror to display available updates.
* **🗄️ SQL Database:** Faster and more reliable caching compared to legacy `.txt` file parsing.
* **⚙️ Familiar Logic:** Utilizes the same reliable game lists and logic as Rookie for full consistency.
* **💾 Storage Check:** Proactively warns you if you are low on space before initiating a download.
* **🎬 Game Trailers:** Tap a game card to instantly watch the trailer and preview gameplay.
* **✅ Downloaded Status:** Clearly marks currently installed games to prevent duplicate downloads.
* **🤝 Donations:** Built-in feature allowing users to donate game files directly back to Rookie’s servers.
* **🛠️ Customization:** A dedicated settings menu to tailor the Squire experience to your preferences.

> **Note:** Please wait for the local cache progress bar to finish before closing the app to ensure data integrity.
