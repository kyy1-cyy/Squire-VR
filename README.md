## Getting Started
1. Enable “Install unknown apps” and grant file access on your Quest
2. Build or install the APK | [Latest Release](https://github.com/kyy1-cyy/Squire-VR/releases/latest)
3. Launch Squire VR and wait while the catalog config loads
4. Browse, download, and manage games

## How It Works
- The app fetches public VRP config at startup and populates runtime settings (base URI + password)
- Each game entry carries the base URI/password for downloading and streaming
- Uninstall uses a resilient multi-path flow and updates UI instantly
