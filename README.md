## Overview
**Squire VR** is a native Android app that lets you browse and download games directly from the VRP Games mirror on your Meta Quest.  
No PC or phone required.

Think of it as a lightweight, standalone version of Rookie Sideloader.

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No PC Needed** | Download games directly on your Quest. |
| **Resume Support** | Pause and resume downloads anytime.  |
| **Updates Tab** | Automatically compares installed games with the mirror and shows available updates. |
| **SQL Database** | Faster, more reliable caching compared to old `.txt` files. |
| **Smart Download Engine** | Self-healing logic to prevent errors like `Error: null`. |
| **Rookie Logic** | Uses the same game lists and logic as familiar tools. |
| **Storage Check** | Warns you if there isn’t enough space before downloading. |
| **AutoSideload** | Installs the APK and moves OBB files automatically. |
| **Downloaded Status** | Installed games are clearly marked to avoid duplicates. |

> **Tip:**  
> Wait for the local cache progress bar to finish before closing the app.
