# Squire VR 🛡️

A simple, standalone game downloader for Meta Quest. No PC or phone required.

### What is this?
Squire VR is a native Android app that lets you browse and download games directly from the VRP mirrors right on your headset. It’s basically a lightweight version of Rookie Sideloader that lives on your Quest.

### Features
- **No PC needed**: Just open the app on your Quest and start downloading.
- **Rookie Logic**: It uses the same mirrors and logic as the apps you already know.
- **Fast & Reliable**: Handles downloading and extraction smoothly with real-time ETA and speed.
- **Storage Check**: Automatically warns you if you don't have enough space before you start a download.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Wipes the temporary archive files once the game is extracted to save space.

### How to use
1. Download the latest `.apk` from the **Releases** section.
2. Sideload it to your Quest once (then you're good for life).
3. Open the app and give it "All Files Access" (it needs this to save games to your `/sdcard/Download` folder).
4. Find a game, hit download, and wait for the success box.

### Credits
Huge thanks to the VRP team for the mirrors and keeping everything running for the community.
