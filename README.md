# Squire VR 🛡️

A simple, standalone game downloader for Meta Quest for Rookie's Servers. No PC or phone required.

### What is this?
Squire VR is a native Android app that lets you browse and download games directly from the VRP Games right on your headset. It’s basically a lightweight version of Rookie Sideloader that lives on your Quest.

### Features
- **No PC needed**: Just open the app on your Quest and start downloading.
- **Rookie Logic**: Has all the games and logic as the apps you already know.
- **Storage Check**: Automatically warns you if you don't have enough space before you start a download.
- **AutoSideload**: if enabled, when game is done downloading it will begin installing the game ont your headset with a manual apk install then an auto obb folder mover.

### How to use
1. Download the latest `.apk` from the **Releases** section.
2. Sideload it to your Quest once 
3. Open the app and give it "All Files Access" by scrolling down to the app and clicking allow (it needs this to save games to your `/sdcard/Download` folder).
4. Find a game, hit download.

### Credits
Huge thanks to the VRP team for all this and keeping everything running for the community. This project would be nothing without them and if asked to remove this app i will do so.
